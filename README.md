Date Started : Friday, November 8th

Set up the project on Monday, November 4th but due to the busy work week can only start on Friday.

I named the project Haunted Hawker taking the Halloween theme and combining it with Indonesian "Angkringan" or hawker. I made most of the art myself, excluding the foods, people and background which were AI generated or free assets but re-edit them in Photoshop.

List of assets I made :
- Table
- Serve area
- UI Button Base
- Sambal Condiment
- Acar Condiment
- Condiment Mat
- Customer order panel
- Grill

List of assets I re-edit in Photoshop:
- All of the satays
- Game Logo (AI generated thetyphography)
- Backgrounds (AI generated)
- Icons
- Plates
- Steel baking sheet
